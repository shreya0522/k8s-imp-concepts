## üîê IAM & Security (High Priority)

# 1. **How do you allow an EC2 in Account A to access an S3 bucket in Account B?**

* How to upload data to an S3 bucket in a different AWS account (called Account B) from your account (Account A) ‚Äî without needing to **share AWS access keys or manually change permissions.**

---

**üß† What‚Äôs the problem?**
* By default: When an EC2 or script from Account A uploads files to an S3 bucket owned by Account B.The uploaded files are ‚Äúowned‚Äù by Account A ‚Äî not Account B. This means Account B might not be able to read/write/delete those files unless:
 - Object ACLs are updated, or
 - Access permissions are manually changed (which is messy and error-prone).

---

**üéØ GOAL:**
* **EC2 in Account A** ‚ûú accesses **S3 bucket in Account B**

---

### üß≠ üîÅ Summary Flow:
* Account B (bucket owner) ‚Üí creates a role that can be assumed by Account A.
* Account A (EC2 owner) ‚Üí creates an IAM role for EC2 with permission to assume the role in Account B.
* EC2 in Account A ‚Üí assumes the Account B role and accesses S3.

---

### üß≠ Step-by-Step:

#### üü© STEP 1: In Account B ‚Üí Create Role to Allow Access

* Login to AWS Console of Account B.
* Go to IAM ‚Üí Roles ‚Üí Create role.
* Trusted entity type: AWS Account
* Select: Another AWS account ‚Üí enter Account A's Account ID
* Attach policy (example for S3 read access)

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["s3:GetObject", "s3:ListBucket"],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name",
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
* Name it: CrossAccountS3AccessRole
* Create the role.
* Copy the Role ARN ‚Äî e.g., arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_B_ID:role/CrossAccountS3AccessRole

---

#### üü¶ STEP 2: In Account A ‚Üí Create Role for EC2 to Assume Role from B

* Login to AWS Console of Account A.
* Go to IAM ‚Üí Roles ‚Üí Create role.
* Choose:
   * Trusted entity: AWS service
   * Use case: EC2
* Name it: EC2AssumeRoleToS3
* Create the role (initially no permissions).
* Open the role ‚Üí go to Permissions ‚Üí click Add inline policy.
* Add this inline policy
```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_B_ID:role/CrossAccountS3AccessRole"
    }
  ]
}
```
* Save as: AssumeS3RolePolicy

#### üü® STEP 3: Attach IAM Role to EC2 in Account A
* Go to EC2 ‚Üí Instances ‚Üí Select Instance
* Choose Actions ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Modify IAM Role
* Attach EC2AssumeRoleToS3 role

#### üüß STEP 4: Configure .aws/config in EC2
* SSH into the EC2 and create an AWS profile:
```
mkdir -p ~/.aws

cat <<EOT >> ~/.aws/config
[profile s3crossaccount]
role_arn = arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_B_ID:role/CrossAccountS3AccessRole
credential_source = Ec2InstanceMetadata
EOT
```

#### üü™ STEP 5: Test Role Assumption
```
aws sts get-caller-identity --profile s3crossaccount
```
* You should see arn:aws:sts::ACCOUNT_B_ID:assumed-role/CrossAccountS3AccessRole/‚Ä¶

#### üü´ STEP 6: Access the S3 Bucket
```
aws s3 ls s3://your-bucket-name --profile s3crossaccount
```
* You should see the files or folders listed.

#### üìå TL;DR
| Step | Account | What You Do                                                 |
| ---- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | B       | Create a role that allows S3 access and can be assumed by A |
| 2    | A       | Create EC2 role that can assume role from B                 |
| 3    | A       | Attach role to EC2                                          |
| 4    | A (EC2) | Add profile config for role assumption                      |
| 5    | A (EC2) | Verify access with AWS CLI                                  |

| Feature                     | **VPC Peering**                        | **AWS PrivateLink**                           |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Access Control**          | Full VPC-to-VPC routing (broad access) | Access only to specific services (tight)      |
| **Granularity**             | Wide (you expose full VPC CIDR)        | Narrow (you expose one service/NLB only)      |
| **Risk Surface**            | Higher (entire VPC is reachable)       | Lower (only specific ports/services exposed)  |
| **Cross-account filtering** | Complex (uses route tables + SGs)      | Simple (via service sharing and endpoint SGs) |
| **Public IP exposure**      | Not used                               | Not used                                      |

| Feature              | **VPC Peering**                    | **PrivateLink**                          |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Latency**          | Slightly faster (direct VPC route) | Slight overhead (through endpoint + NLB) |

üì¶ 3. USE CASE FIT FOR RDS CROSS-ACCOUNT
-----------------------------------------

| Criteria                           | VPC Peering                    |  PrivateLink                          |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------|-------------------------------------- |
| **RDS cross-account sharing**      | Not granular, over-shares VPC  | ‚úÖ Secure service-level access to RDS |
| **Least privilege principle**      | ‚ùå Violated                    | ‚úÖ Followed                           |
| **Multi-tenant / SaaS setup**      | ‚ùå Not scalable                | ‚úÖ Scalable and secure                |
| **IAM-based access control**       | ‚ùå Not supported               | ‚úÖ Supported via endpoint policies    |
| **Centralized access to services** | ‚ùå Difficult                   | ‚úÖ Built for that                     |


‚úÖ Best practice (especially for RDS/DB): 
- Use PrivateLink Because it:
   - Limits exposure to just the database
   - Can handle RDS failover with NLB automation
   - Keeps you isolated and auditable

So for your goal (RDS access only):
üîí Use PrivateLink ‚Äî it's more secure, more controlled, and built for this exact use case.

Resource List for both A/c
---------------------------

üìò Account A (Consumer / EC2 client)
----------------------------------------

| # | Resource                            | Purpose                                        | 
| - | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | **EC2 instance**                    | The app that connects to the RDS               | main
| 2 | **Interface VPC Endpoint (VPCE)**   | Connects to PrivateLink service from Account B | main
| 3 | **Security Group for EC2**          | Outbound access to port 3306 (MySQL)           | main
| 4 | **Security Group for VPC Endpoint** | Inbound access from EC2 SG on port 3306        | main
| 5 | **IAM Role (optional)**             | If needed for endpoint access or tagging       | optional


‚úÖ Total: 5 resources (EC2 + VPCE + SGs)

üìô Account B (Provider / RDS owner)
------------------------------------

| #  | Resource                             | Purpose                                             |
| -- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 1  | **RDS MySQL instance (Multi-AZ)**    | Actual database with automatic failover support     | main
| 2  | **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**      | Forwards traffic from PrivateLink to RDS            | main
| 3  | **Target Group**                     | Holds IPs of current RDS primary, used by NLB       |
| 4  | **VPC Endpoint Service**             | Shares NLB across accounts via PrivateLink          | main
| 5  | **Lambda Function**                  | Handles NLB IP update on RDS failover               | optional 
| 6  | **SNS Topic**                        | Gets RDS failover events and triggers Lambda        | optional
| 7  | **CloudWatch Event Rule** (optional) | Can also trigger Lambda for scheduled health checks | optional
| 8  | **Security Group for RDS**           | Allows inbound from NLB subnets or SG               |
| 9  | **IAM Role for Lambda**              | Allows it to call EC2, ELB, Route53, etc.           | optional
| 10 | **Route 53 Query** (implicit)        | Lambda reads DNS record to fetch current RDS IP     | optional

‚úÖ Total: 5 resources (RDS + NLB + Endpoint Service + Target Group + SGs)

WHY LAMBDA & SNS IS OPTIONAL 
--------------------------------
Without lamda and sns everything will work fine , they are needed only when rds is multizone and 1 zone failure (or patching by aws) , so if rds is down aws will point to another rds in such case nlb will keep pointing traffic to old rds so manual intervention will be required to change the IP , inspite what we can do is  
- when RDS Failover Happens , AWS promotes a new RDS instance as primary &  IP address changes
- RDS sends this event to SNS (Simple Notification Service) . SNS = A message broadcaster (It says: ‚Äú‚ö†Ô∏è Hey, failover just happened!‚Äù)
- SNS triggers a Lambda function , The Lambda function wakes up automatically . It‚Äôs subscribed to that SNS topic
- Lambda script does the following
   * Fetches the current IP of the new RDS using its DNS name
   * Looks at the old IP still registered in the NLB Target Group
   * Compares the two IPs
- If IP has changed:
   * Lambda deregisters the old IP from the NLB
   * Then registers the new IP to the NLB Target Group

‚úÖ Now NLB forwards traffic to the correct, new RDS instance.

WHY ROLE IS OPTIONAL FOR EC2 & RDS 
----------------------------------
If your app on EC2 just wants to connect to RDS using username + password, and you're using PrivateLink, that is enough.

üîê Then why was "IAM role" mentioned in the resource list?
IAM roles are only needed for:
| Case                                                      | Need IAM Role? |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| EC2 connecting to RDS using username + password           | ‚ùå No           |
| EC2 connecting using **IAM Authentication** (token-based) | ‚úÖ Yes          |
| Lambda needs to call EC2, ELB, or Route53 APIs            | ‚úÖ Yes          |
| EC2 wants to create VPC endpoints programmatically        | ‚úÖ Yes          |

Since your app EC2 is connecting to RDS via PrivateLink + MySQL creds, and you're not using IAM-based DB auth, then: ‚úÖ You do not need an IAM role on EC2 to access RDS.


```

```
If SG is asked then 
----------------------
You‚Äôll deal with three SGs:
1. SG for RDS instance (in Account B)
2. SG for Network Load Balancer Target Group (in Account B)
3. SG for Interface VPC Endpoint (in Account A)

| Component           | Rule Type | Direction | Port                                 | Source                |
| ------------------- | --------- | --------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| **RDS SG**          | Inbound   | 3306      | SG attached to NLB (or NLB subnet)   |                       |
| **NLB ‚Üí RDS**       | ‚Äî         | ‚Äî         | ‚Äî                                    | No SG, handled by NLB |
| **VPC Endpoint SG** | Inbound   | 3306      | SG of EC2                            |                       |
| **EC2 SG**          | Outbound  | 3306      | SG of VPC Endpoint (or all outbound) |                       |


```

==============================================================

# 3. How do you share an AMI from Account A to B?
```
Share AMI permissions (ModifyImagePermission):
By default, when you go to the AMI section in the EC2 console, you‚Äôll see only the AMIs owned by your account.
To share an AMI:
Go to AMI > Actions > Edit AMI permissions > Private > Add account ID > Share > Save changes.

Also share the EBS snapshot permissions (if the AMI is EBS-backed):
Do the same steps for the associated snapshot: go to Snapshots, find the one used by the AMI, and edit its permissions to add the target account.

In Account B:
Go to the AMI section in EC2.
Change the filter from Owned by me to Private images.
You‚Äôll see the shared AMI listed there.

(Optional) If you want that AMI to be permanently owned by Account B, launch an EC2 instance using the shared AMI, then create a new AMI from that instance ‚Äî this new AMI will be owned by Account B.
```
==============================================================

# 4. What is "Assume Role"

Imagine: You have two AWS accounts:
Account A (your EC2, Lambda, etc.)
Account B (your resources like S3, RDS, etc.)

Let‚Äôs say:
- You're in Account A, but you want to access something in Account B
- You don‚Äôt want to copy credentials or make everything public
- So AWS gives you a safe and temporary way to do this:

> ü™™ "Assume a role" means:
> "Let me temporarily become a trusted person in Account B, just for this task, with limited permissions."

#### üß† How It Works

### In Account B (where the resource lives):
- You create an IAM Role
- You say: ‚ÄúThis role can be assumed by Account A (or a specific role in Account A)‚Äù
- You attach a policy to that role (e.g., S3 read access)

### In Account A (your app):
- Your EC2, Lambda, or script assumes that role using AWS SDK or CLI
- AWS gives you temporary credentials
- You now "act like" someone from Account B just for the allowed actions

‚úÖ No need to create IAM users
‚úÖ No need to share permanent keys


#### üõ†Ô∏è What‚Äôs needed for AssumeRole to work?
- In Account B:
  - IAM Role with:
      * Trust policy to allow Account A to assume it
      * Permissions to access the resources (S3, RDS, etc.)

- In Account A:
  - Code (or EC2/Lambda) that assumes the role using AWS STS

#### ‚úÖ Can I make any resource in Account A talk to Account B?
Yes ‚Äî if you configure it properly, then resources in Account A can securely talk to resources in Account B.
| Communication Type        | Is it possible? | Needs...                               |
| ------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| EC2 ‚Üí S3 in Account B     | ‚úÖ Yes           | IAM role with AssumeRole + trust setup |
| Lambda ‚Üí RDS in Account B | ‚úÖ Yes           | PrivateLink + IAM + SG rules           |
| VPC ‚Üí VPC traffic         | ‚úÖ Yes           | VPC Peering / PrivateLink / Transit GW |
| S3 replication A ‚Üí B      | ‚úÖ Yes           | IAM + Bucket policy + trust            |

‚úÖ So yes ‚Äî you can make almost any resource in Account A talk to Account B securely ‚Äî but it requires the right IAM and network setup.

==================================================================

# in above case when ec2 (account A) needed to connect to rds (acoount B) . Can i use assumerole instead of private link 
Yes, you can use AssumeRole without PrivateLink,
but only if the target service is reachable over the network (either public, or via other means).

If the target is private and in a different VPC/account, then you'd also need PrivateLink or VPC peering to reach it ‚Äî and AssumeRole to get permissions (if needed).

========================================================================

# Can an EC2 in a private subnet in Account A follow the  steps (same as private link Q.1 ) to access S3 in Account B?
‚úÖ Yes ‚Äî but only if the EC2 has a network path to reach AWS APIs (like STS and S3).

Your steps are correct in terms of IAM configuration, but the missing piece is network connectivity, because EC2 in a private subnet can't access the internet by default.

‚úÖ What you must have additionally (very important):
| Requirement           | Why needed?                                     | How to fulfill it if EC2 is in private subnet                    |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Access to STS API** | To call `sts:AssumeRole` and get credentials    | - Add a **VPC endpoint for STS**, or<br> - Use a **NAT Gateway** |
| **Access to S3 API**  | To actually call S3 and upload/download objects | - Add a **VPC endpoint for S3**, or<br> - Use a **NAT Gateway**  |


if your EC2 is in a private subnet and it has a route to a NAT Gateway in the public subnet, then: ‚úÖ It can reach the internet and call external services ‚Äî including AWS APIs (STS, S3, etc.) So if: sudo apt update
works successfully from that EC2 instance, then that confirms üì° Internet access is working
üîÅ So in your case: ‚úÖ Yes, the steps you shared for AssumeRole + cross-account S3 access will work as-is, because: EC2 has internet access (via NAT), It can call STS and S3 endpoints ,IAM roles and permissions handle the rest

==============================================================================

# Can EC2 in Account A (private subnet with NAT) access RDS in Account B using just AssumeRole, and no PrivateLink?

‚ùå No ‚Äî AssumeRole alone is NOT enough to access RDS in another account.

üß† Why it works with S3 but not with RDS
| Feature                   | S3                                        | RDS                                        |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Global service**        | ‚úÖ Yes (publicly accessible endpoint)      | ‚ùå No (VPC-only resource)                   |
| **Needs network access?** | üåê Not really (S3 is internet-accessible) | ‚úÖ Yes (RDS lives in private VPC)           |
| **Can AssumeRole help?**  | ‚úÖ Yes (for access rights)                 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Only if you already have network access |

‚úÖ AssumeRole helps with permissions
AssumeRole lets EC2 in Account A ‚Äúbecome‚Äù someone who has access rights to RDS in Account B.
But...
‚ùå AssumeRole does not create a network path
RDS in Account B is a VPC resource (in private subnet), so:
Even if you assume a role that has rds:Connect or rds:DescribeDBInstances, it‚Äôs useless if you can‚Äôt reach the RDS endpoint over the network.

üß± Example:
- EC2 in Account A (has NAT ‚Üí can reach internet and AWS APIs)
-  RDS in Account B (in private subnet ‚Äî no public IP, no peering, no PrivateLink)

‚ùå What will happen:
- EC2 can assume the role ‚úÖ
- But when you run: ```mysql -h <rds-endpoint> -u admin -p``` . You'll get a timeout üî• because EC2 has no path to reach RDS
‚úÖ How to make it work: 
| Option                  | Description                                         |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **VPC Peering**         | Peers VPCs in both accounts (but exposes full CIDR) |
| **PrivateLink + NLB** ‚úÖ | Exposes only the RDS service securely               |
| **Transit Gateway**     | Works for large/multi-VPC setups                    |
| ‚ùå Just IAM Role         | Won‚Äôt work without one of the above                 |
