1- What is Elasticsearch?
A- Elasticsearch is:
    - A search engine that helps you quickly find information in big amounts of data.
    - It is built on Apache Lucene (a powerful library for search).
    - It’s distributed, meaning it can work across many servers together.
    - It provides a REST API, so you can interact with it using HTTP (like a web browser or Postman).

2- What problem does it solve?
A- Imagine you have logs, documents, metrics, or JSON data and want to:
     - 🔎 Search quickly (e.g., find errors in logs)
     - 📊 Analyze the data (e.g., how many errors per hour?)
     - 💡 Get results in near real-time
Traditional databases are not built for this kind of fast, flexible searching. Elasticsearch solves that.

3- 👩‍💻 Why does a DevOps/Ops person care?
A- 
   -  Used in ELK Stack (Elasticsearch + Logstash + Kibana) for log analysis
   -  Used in SIEM tools (security event monitoring)
   -  Need to understand:
         * Cluster setup (distributed system)
         * HA (High Availability)
         * Scaling (add/remove nodes)
         * Backups
         * Upgrades

ATOM CONCEPT : 
🔠 A — Atomicity
All or nothing: A transaction (like transferring ₹500 from A to B) must complete entirely or not at all. If anything fails, everything is rolled back. Think of it like a text message — it either sends completely or doesn't send at all, never halfway.

🔠 C — Consistency
The database must always remain in a valid state. Rules (like “you can’t have negative money in an account”) are always followed. Example: If A has ₹1000, and you transfer ₹1200 — the database rejects it because it would break a rule.

🔠 I — Isolation
Transactions run independently from each other.One user’s transaction won’t interfere with another’s. Imagine two people editing a Google Doc — isolation makes sure their changes don’t overwrite each other in a bad way.

🔠 D — Durability
Once a transaction is committed, it’s saved permanently — even if the server crashes. Like clicking “Save” on a file — even after your laptop crashes, the file is still there.

Atomicity means: A single operation (like inserting one document) either completes fully or not at all. No in-between state. This ensures the data is either written or rolled back cleanly.
✅ Does Elasticsearch support Atomicity?
Yes — but only in a limited way:
  - ✅ Atomic per single document: 
 * If you index (insert/update) one document, Elasticsearch ensures it's written fully or not at all on the primary shard.
 * You will never get a half-written document.

  - ❌ Not atomic for multiple documents
 * If you want to write/update/delete multiple documents as a group, there’s no rollback if something fails partway.
 * Elasticsearch does not support transactions like a relational DB (e.g., BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK).
Example: If you're trying to update 3 documents and 1 fails, the other 2 stay changed — no automatic rollback.

⚙️ How does it achieve this?
When a document is indexed:
   - It's written to the primary shard (main copy).
   - Once confirmed, it is asynchronously replicated to replica shards.
If something fails before writing to the primary shard completes, the operation fails completely — nothing is written.

💡 So, in summary:
| Feature                     | Supported in Elasticsearch? |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Atomic write for 1 document | ✅ Yes                       |
| Atomic write for many docs  | ❌ No                        |
| Rollback on failure         | ❌ No                        |
| Asynchronous replication    | ✅ Yes                       |
